                                We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons. <br>

                            <p class="description" style="text-transform: none;">
                                Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) made available through Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will apply.
                            </p>
                            <h5 class="author-name">Subscriptions</h5>
                            <p class="description" style="text-transform: none;">
                                Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. <br>
                                At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Publiso cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting info.publiso@gmail.com customer support team. <br>
                                A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Publiso with accurate and complete billing information that may include but not limited to full name, address, state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Publiso to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. <br>
                                Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Publiso reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service with immediate effect.
                            </p>
                            <h5 class="author-name">Fee Changes</h5>
                            <p class="description" style="text-transform: none;">
                                Publiso, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. <br>
                                Publiso will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. <br>
                                Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
                            </p>
